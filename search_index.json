that allow concurrent updates of shared data structures without the need to perform costly synchronization between threads. This method ensures that no threads block for arbitrarily long times, and it guarantee progress for some threads when there are multiple threads.\nLock-free algorithms are carefully designed data-structures and functions to allow for multiple threads to attempt to make progress independently of one-another. This means that you do not try to acquire a lock before performing your critical region. Instead, you independently update a local copy of a portion of the data-structure and then apply it atomically to the shared structure with a CAS(Compare-And-Swap).\nLock-free programming has the following advantages:\n\nCan be used in places where locks must be avoided, such as interrupt handlers\nAvoid the troubles with blocking, such as deadlock and priority inversion\nImprove performance on a multi-core processor\n\nNow, let's begin to design the lock-free data-structure.\n"},"c11-features-in-currency.html":{"url":"c11-features-in-currency.html","title":"C11 features in concurrency","keywords":"","body":"C11 Overview\nC11 is an informal name for ISO/IEC 9899:2011, the current standard for the C programming language. It includes multi-threading support , which enables us higher-level programming types to deal with concurrency now. Then, let's see how to use the C11 features to design the lock-free data-structures.\nC11 Atomic types\nC11 defines a new _Atomic type specifier. The atomic declaration syntax is like this:\n_Atomic (type_name) or\n_Atomic type_name\nThe type_name can not be an array type, a function type, an atomic type, or a qualified type. For example, we could define an atomic integer like this:\n_Atomic(int) a; //or\n_Atomic int b; //both of them are the atomic integer\nPlease be sure to include the header \"#include\" when you are using the atomic type in your program.\nAlso, we could define a use-defined struct atomic types, which enable the struct to be manipulated atomically.\nstruct Node\n{\n    int data;\n    struct Node *next;\n};\n_Atomic struct Node s; //s is also an atomic type\nIn addition to the ability to define user-defined atomic types, the _Atomic keyword makes it possible to use objects of all atomic types in nearly all the same expressions and contexts as their direct (non-atomic) counterparts.\n_Atomic int a = 3; // initialize like a normal int type\na = a + 2; //you can perform the atomic addition like this\nHere is a simple example of using C11 atomic type:\ntest.c\n#include\n#include\n#include\n\n_Atomic int acnt;\nint cnt;\nvoid *adding(void *input)\n{\n    for(int i=0; iIn order to compile C11 program, we need GCC4.9 or later. We should specify the parameter to tell the gcc compiler that we would like to compile the program by using C11 standard.

Here I will introduce the CAS function, which we will use in lock-free data-struct designing.\n_Bool atmoic_compare_exchange_weak(volatile A *object, C *expected, C desired);\nDescription: Atomically,  compares the value pointed to by object for equality with that in expected, and if true, replaces the value  pointed to by object with desired, and if false, updates the value in expected with the value pointed to by object. (Here, A means atomic type, while the C means the non-atomic type corresponding to A, for example, if A is _Atomic int , then, C is int)\nThe volatile is a type qualifier, like const, and is a property of the type. It indicates that a value may change between different accesses (eg: shared variable in multi-threading program), even if it does not appear to be modified. With the volatile keyword, the compiler knows a variable needs to be reread from memory at each use, and it prevents the compiler from performing optimization on code. For more information, please refer to this link:\nhttp://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-volatile-qualifier-c-set-1-introduction/\nReturns: the result of the comparison, true or false.\nHere, we will use the function to implement a simple lock.\n#include\n#include\n#include\n\nint lock = 0;\nint lock_count = 0;\nint unlock_count = 0;\n\nvoid *counting(void *input)\n{\n    int expected = 0;\n    for(int i = 0; ione of the possible outputs is:\nthe value of lock_count is 1000000 (correct)\nthe value of unlock_count is 998578 (wrong)\nFor more information, please refer to http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf\n"},"lock-free-vs-spin-lock.html":{"url":"lock-free-vs-spin-lock.html","title":"lock-free vs spin-lock","keywords":"","body":"Lock-free vs spin-lock\nSo, given a piece of code, how do you know if it's lock-based or lock-free? Let's first see two examples. Both of them are multi-threads get access to a shared variable and do the addition on it. Here is the version by using lock-free programming.\n1  #inlcude\n2  #include\n3  #include\n4\n5  int count = 0;                     \n6  void *adding(void *input)\n7  {\n8      int val;\n9      for(int i=0; iHere, it is the version of spin-lock for the same purpose.\n1  #include\n2  #include\n3  #include\n4   \n5  int count = 0;                     \n6  int lock = 0;\n7  void *adding(void *input)\n8  {\n9      int expected = 0;\n10     for(int i=0; iLet's see the output and performance of the above two programs.\nLock-free:\nthe value of count is 10000000\n\nBelow is the running time:\n\nreal 0m2.687s\nuser 0m10.652s\nsys  0m0.0004s\nLock-based:\nthe value of count is 10000000\n\nBelow is the running time:\n\nreal 0m3.755s\nuser 0m14.820s\nsys  0m0.012s\nFrom the above result, we could see that lock-free program is better than spin-lock program because lock-free program uses less running time. Let's see the addition part of both programs.(For the lock-free program, it is the code from line 11 to 13, for the spin-lock program, it is the code from line 12 to 15) They're both loops, and very similarly-looking ones. Moreover, we can loop at both loops for a period of time. How come they're at the opposite sides of the locking/lock-free distinction?! Does lock-free program really perform better than lock-based program?\nLet's first see an example.\n   lock-free\n\nlock-based\n\nThere are 4 threads modify the shared variable count, and they try to get access to the shared variable count and do the addition on it. From the above two images, we could see that in lock-free program, while thread 1 is accessing the shared variable count, other threads could also get access to the count. However, for the lock-based program, while thread 1is accessing the shared variable count, it holds the lock so other threads could not access the count but looping. So, here, we could see the difference between them. For the lock-free program, every thread could get access to the shared object no matter whether another thread is accessing the shared object or not.(Although sometimes, there could be some conflicts(just like thread 1), and the thread should redo its work. ) However, for the lock-based program, if one thread is accessing the shared object, other threads would be blocked and have no way to get access to the shared object. Also, from the above images, we could also know why the above lock-free program is quicker than lock-based program.\nHowever, does lock-free program always perform better than lock-based program? Let's see an example.\nlock-free\n\nlock-based\n\nIn the above examples, we could see that the progress of lock-based program is quicker than lock-free program.

We will implement a linked list lock-free stack by using the C11 knowledge we learnt before.\nLet's see the process of pushing a node into a stack.\n\nThis works fine in a single-threaded context, but if other threads are also modifying the stack, it’s not enough. Let's see what would happen if two threads push a node into the stack concurrently.\n\nOK, so what can you do about this nasty race condition in a lock-free data-structure? The answer is to use an atomic compare and swap(CAS) operation to set the head node to point to your new node when CAS is sure that the head hasn’t been modified since you last read it. If it has, you can loop and try again.\nstack.h\n1   #include\n2   #include\n3   #include\n4  \n5   //the node type in the stack\n6   typedef struct _Node\n7   {\n8       int data;\n9       struct _Node* next;\n10  }Node;\n11  //the stack\n12  typedef struct _lfstack_t\n13  {\n14      Node *head;\n15  }lfstack_t;\n16 \n17  //the push function\n18  void lfstack_push(_Atomic lfstack_t *lfstack, int value)\n19  {\n20      lfstack_t next;\n21      lfstack_t orig = atomic_load(lfstack); //here we need a local copy of lfstack, however, lfstack is a pointer\n22                                             //we could not get the content from a struct pointer atomically by assignment\n23                                             //C11 provides us a function for us to atomically get the content from the location that \n24                                             //a atomic type pointer points to.\n25      Node *node = malloc(sizeof(Node)); //the new node, step 1\n26      node->data = value;\n27      do{\n28          node->next = orig.head; //step 2\n29          next.head = node; //local change of head\n30      }while(!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(lfstack,&orig,next)); //if the lfstack is not changed by others, apply the local change of head to it\n31  }\nThe pop function is also the same way of analyzing, and we let the analysis for students. Here is the pop function:\nstack.h\n1   //pop function\n2   int lfstack_pop(_Atomic lfstack_t *lfstack)\n3   {\n4       lfstack_t next;\n5       lfstack_t orig = atomic_load(lfstack);\n6       do{\n7           if(orig.head == NULL) //return when the stack is empty\n8           {\n9               return -1;\n10          }\n11          next.head = orig.head->next; //set the head to the next node\n12      }while(!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(lfstack,&orig,next)); //if the head of stack is not changed, update the stack\n13      printf(\"poping value %d\\n\",orig.head->data); //just want to see the poping value.\n14      free(orig.head); // free the poping node\n15      return 0;\n16  }\nNext, we put the lock-free stack in a multi-threading environment to be accessed as a shared data-structure.\nmain.c\n1   #include \"stack.h\"\n2   #include \n3   #include \n4   _Atomic lfstack_t top = {NULL};\n5   void *push(void *input)\n6   {\n7       for(int i=0; iActually, the print statement is not run together after they push/pop a node, so you may not see the print results as a LIFO logic, but I think you could understand it. We should compile the program by using the command:\ngcc -std=c11 -pthread -o main main.c\nThe program seems perfect, but the program will abort when you run it. Here is a underlying problem that you may not notice, it is called ABA problem and I will introduce it to you next.\n"},"aba-problem.html":{"url":"aba-problem.html","title":"ABA problem","keywords":"","body":"ABA problem\nThe use of CAS has one problem to deal with.  It is called the ABA problem.  The problem arises from the C of CAS, where the comparison is value based.  That is, as long as the value involved in the comparison is the same, the swap can proceed.  However, there are still occasions that fool the CAS solution we presented.  Let's see an example where three threads concurrently access the lock-free stack we presented:(Ps: In our case, it is not necessary for the newly allocated node's content is the same as the original node, they just need to use the same memory block)\nABA Problem Solutions\nThe root solution to ABA problem is that we should defer reclamation while other threads are holding the node or we should have a way to identify the difference between the old node and the new node.\nThere are several solutions to the ABA problem, for the details, you can see this link. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem\nHere, I would introduce a common solution for you.\nA common workaround is to add extra \"tag\" or \"stamp\" word to the quantity being considered. For example, an algorithm using compare and swap on a pointer might use a \"tag\" to indicate how many times the pointer has been successfully modified. Because of this, the next compare-and-swap will fail, even if the addresses are the same, because the tag word will not match.  This is sometimes called ABAʹ since the second A is made slightly different from the first.\nHere , we solve the ABA problem by using the above solution. We reconstruct the stack by adding a \"tag\":\ntypedef struct _lfstack_t\n{\n    int tag;\n    Node *head;\n}\nEvery time when we use the pointer, we will increase the \"tag\" by 1.\nvoid lfstack_push(_Atomic lfstack_t *lfstack, int value)\n{\n    lfstack_t next, orig = atomic_load(lfstack);\n    Node *node = malloc(sizeof(Node));\n    node->data = value;\n    do{\n        node->next = orig.head;\n        next.head = node;\n        next.tag = orig.tag+1; //increase the \"tag\"\n    }while(!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(lfstack,&orig,next));\n}\n\nint lfstack_pop(_Atomic lfstack_t *lfstack)\n{\n    lfstack_t next, orig = atomic_load(lfstack);\n    do{\n       if(orig.head == NULL)\n       {\n            return -1;\n       }\n       next.head = orig.head->next;\n       next.tag = orig.tag+1; //increase the \"tag\"\n    }while(!atomic_compare_exchange_weak(lfstack,&orig,next));\n    printf(\"poping value %d\\n\",orig.head->data);\n    free(orig.head);\n    return 0;\n}\nDon't forget to change the initialization of stack.\n_Atomic lfstack_t top = {0,NULL};\nNow, when we run the program again, it will not print any error information. Here is a C library called liblfds, https://www.liblfds.org/, a lock-free data structure library written in C. If you don't like to write the lock-free data structure by yourself, you could use this C library.\nLet's compare the lock-free stack with the stack implement by using mutex. Here is the code of the lock-based stack.\nlock_based_stack.c\n#include\n#include\n#include\n\ntypedef struct Node{\n    int data;\n    struct Node *next;\n}Node;\n\nNode *head = NULL;\npthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;\nvoid *push(void *input)\n{\n    for(int i=0; idata = i;\n        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);\n        node->next = head;\n        head = node;\n        //printf(\"pushing value %d\\n\",node->data);\n        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);\n    }\n    pthread_exit(NULL);\n}\n\nvoid *pop(void *input)\n{\n    for(int i=0; inext;\n            //printf(\"poping value %d\\n\",pop_node->data);\n            free(pop_node);\n            i++;\n            pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);\n        }\n    }\n    pthread_exit(NULL);\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    pthread_t tid[200];\n    for(int i=0; iI compare the lock-free stack and lock-based stack by measuring their running time. In order to compare their efficiency, I comment the \"printf\" statement in both of the programs. I use the built-in command time in linux to measure their running time.\nHere are the average results by running each of them 10 times.\nlock-free stack\nreal 0m2.133s\nuser 0m6.140s\nsys  0m0.946s\nlock-based stack\nreal 0m2.730s\nuser 0m3.594s\nsys  0m4.907s\nFrom the result, we could see that lock-free stack is more efficient than lock-based stack while doing the same thing.  Actually, if you pay attention to the implementation above, a lock-free stack is logically using a spin lock as well.  Moreover, recall that pthread library's mutex is also implemented using CAS.  So, why one is faster than the other?\nThe answer is, the one that uses CAS to implement is a direct low-level implementation that uses CAS instructions, whereas the one that uses pThread is implemented using the pThread's library.  Think about the use of \"ls -l | less\" vs the use of a GUI file manager to browse a directory.  The former is efficient but primitives, more suitable for advanced users.  The latter is easier and has more overhead (e.g., rendering the GUI).  Similarly, the pThread-based stack is easier to implement (using mutex), higher-level, but incurs syscall overhead within the mutex implementation (e.g., wait() and context switch).  In contrast, the CAS one we presented above is lower-level (almost direct use of CAS instructions), direct (so that involves no sys call), but it is much more cumbersome to implement (e.g., take care of the ABA problem yourself).\nTherefore, lock-free implementation in essence is for advanced developers, especially, system developers, who aim for highest efficiency.  Remember, the lock-free implementation above essentially implements a spin lock implicitly and it is \"lock-free\" just because it is (high-level) mutex lock free only.\n"},"reference.html":{"url":"reference.html","title":"Reference","keywords":"","body":"Reference and useful links\nIntroduction to look-free, wait free and the ABA problem:\nhttp://www.hergert.me/blog/2009/12/25/intro-to-lock-free-wait-free-and-aba.html\nISO/IEC 9899:2011:\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf\nToward a Better Use of C11 Atomics:\nhttps://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/01/14/toward-a-better-use-of-c11-atomics-part-1/\nC++ concurrency in action:\nhttp://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/files/CplusplusConcurrencyInAction_PracticalMultithreading.pdf\nC11 lock free stack:\nhttp://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/09/02/\nLock-Free Programming - Herb Sutter - CppCon 2014:\nhttps://github.com/CppCon/CppCon2014/blob/master/Presentations/Lock-Free%20Programming%20(or%2C%20Juggling%20Razor%20Blades)/Lock-Free%20Programming%20(or%2C%20Juggling%20Razor%20Blades)%20-%20Herb%20Sutter%20-%20CppCon%202014.pdf\nHazard pointers: safe memory reclamation for lock-free objects:\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1291819/#full-text-section\nIt's \"locking\" if it's blocking\nhttps://yosefk.com/blog/its-locking-if-its-blocking.html\nDo lock-free algorithms really perform better than their lock-full counterparts?\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/5680869/do-lock-free-algorithms-really-perform-better-than-their-lock-full-counterparts/\n"}}}
